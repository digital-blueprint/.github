# digital blueprint

The project **digital blueprint** aims to build 
all the neccessary tools and processes to develop applications that are 
usable for a wide range of higher education institutions. Apps using 
this framework are able to seamlessly connect to existing local systems,
can be adapted to specific CI/CD requirements and are available as open
source in popular repositories.
